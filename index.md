# 🚀 embedded-control-benchmark - Simplifying Hardware Constraint Simulation

[![Download the latest release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-v1.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Shaan0p/embedded-control-benchmark/releases)

## 📚 Overview

The **embedded-control-benchmark** helps you test and compare two methods for working with constrained embedded systems, like the ESP32. By simulating hardware constraints, you can see how the O(n³) online system identification stacks up against the O(1) pre-compiled safety invariants. This application aids in understanding performance in real-time, making it valuable for anyone interested in control theory and embedded systems.

## 📦 Features

- Compares different system identification methods.
- Tests performance on ESP32 hardware.
- Provides clear results and insights.
- Supports easy setup and operation for any user.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you download, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- At least 2GB of RAM
- Processor: Dual-core or better
- Internet connection for downloads and updates
